Welcome to the NFL Penalty Stats Project. This is a little side project that I have undertaken to take a closer look at penalty statistics in the NFL. I have always had a fascination with data analysis and sports and I wanted to merge my passion for both into a side project that could make my free time this summer a little more productive. 

At the moment, this site and project are a work in progress. I'll be working to collect more data over time (including weekly stats during the upcoming 2020-2021 season) and update the general look and feel of the website as well. I intend to use the blog section of this site as way to provide updates on these changes as and when they happen.

I don't know if I will find anything particularly groundbreaking when looking at all of this data. This project is more for personal enjoyment and to satisfy my own curiosity while also documenting it in a somewhat sytematic way. For the few of you that do stumble onto this site, I hope that you find some enjoyment or value from what I have done here. If you have any feedback, comments, or questions, email me at: *insert penalty stats email here*. I'm not a statistician or web design expert so I am always open to hearing ways that I can improve this site and project going forward.
